# visionOS-Workshop-1

A small sample to get in touch with visionOS and learn how everything connects — introducing you to Reality Composer Pro 🎨, the Entity Component System ⚙️, and see how SwiftUI ties it all together 🧩.

For each task is a tag in the repository. It also shows the solution to the previous task.

To start, open the Tasks PDF and checkout the tag "Task-1". Have fun!
